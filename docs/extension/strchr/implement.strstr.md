### 2.8.7 SSE4.2

SSE4.2 introduces 7 new instrictions. These include:

- A 128 bit SIMD integer instruction for comparing 64 bit integer data elements.
- Four string/text processing instructions providing a rich set of primitives, these primitives can accelerate:

    - basic and advanced string library functions from strlen, strcmp, to strcspn.
    - delimiter processing, token extraction for lexing of text stream
    - Parser, schema validation including XML processing

- A general purpose instruction for accelerating cyclic redundancy checksum signature caculations.
- A general purpose instruction for calculating bit count population of integer numbers.
