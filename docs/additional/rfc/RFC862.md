A very useful debugging and measurement tool is an echo service.
An echo service simply sends back to the originating source any data it receives.

## __TCP BASED ECHO SERVICE__

One echo service is defined as a connection based applicatin on TCP.
A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 7.
Once a connection is established any data received is sent back.
This continues until the calling user terminates the conneciton.

## __UDP BASED ECHO SERVICE__

Another echo service is defined as a datagram based application on UDP.
A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port 7.
When a datagram is received, the data from it is sent back in an answering datagram.
